### Citrix Service Montior

On our Citrix VDA Terminal Servers, its very common for three Citrix Printing Services to go down, resulting in users being unable to use their printers. It was once thought that to fix this, the whole server needed to be rebooted, but more recently we know that you can just restart the services. This script provides a simple, remote way to do so. Just run the script (and optionally provide the name of the remote computer as the first argument) and it will restart the services
